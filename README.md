About:
My DMX Controller broke and I have a few ESP32s laying around so I decided to create a very simple DMX Controller running on the ESP32. While there are many projects using the ESP32 as an ArtnetNode, I wanted a controller that runs standalone so I can use my lights without running a whole network and computer with software.

Hardware:
ESP Terminal 3.5-inch Display

Libraries:
-LVGL
-esp_dmx by someweisguy
